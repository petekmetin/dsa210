My Spotify Data and Exam Dates

Motivation

This project combines my Spotify listening data with my exam dates to explore the relationship between my music preferences and exam stress. I aim to uncover whether my music habits change significantly around exam periods and to what extent certain genres or moods in music align with my study habits, stress levels, or moments of relaxation.

Main Research Questions

How do my listening habits change in the days leading up to and following exams?

Are there specific genres, artists, or moods that I gravitate toward during high-stress periods like exams?

Can I identify patterns in my music data that correlate with my exam dates, such as increased listening of calming or instrumental tracks?

Data

Spotify Data: I used my personal Spotify data, including listening history (tracks, timestamps, and genres), which was obtained from Spotify's data export feature.

Exam Dates: I manually added my exam dates to the dataset to analyze my listening trends during those periods.

Data Analysis Plan

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Understand my listening behavior over time, focusing on volume, genre, and artist trends.

Correlation Analysis: Identify any correlations between listening habits and exam dates.

Visualization: Create visual representations of my listening habits during exam versus non-exam periods.

Machine Learning (Optional): Experiment with clustering techniques to determine if distinct patterns can be found during high-stress versus relaxed periods.

Findings

TBD - To be completed as the analysis progresses.

Limitations and Future Work

The data is personalized and may not generalize to others.

Future work could involve gathering more data over multiple semesters or comparing listening data with other indicators of stress
